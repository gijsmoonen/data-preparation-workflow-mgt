The objective of this study is to compare the effect of ADE on the amount listing reviews per neighborhood. The end effect could show the significance of a different ratio in comments left by guests, due to the event happening in the city.

The reviews can be left by guests of Airbnb up to 2 weeks after the end day of the stay. For this reason, the main time period measured against standardized data has been two weeks after the last date of the event.
