### 1. Loading and Inspecting the Data

#### 1.1 Merging Data
[Spotify Charts](https://spotifycharts.com/regional) has listed the daily top 200 most streamed songs by country since 2017. As you can see below, you can use the dropdown menus to change your selection, and clicking in the top right corner returns the data in CSV-format. 

![](./images/spotify-top-200.gif){width=50%}

For this exercise we have collected the rankings for 2020 which have been split up into 3 separate files: 

#### Streams

| Attribute | Definition | Example | 
| :---- | :---- | :---- | 
| song_id | An identifier associated with each song | `22403119` |
| date | The date on which the ranking was composed | `2020-01-01 00:00:00+00:00` | 
| popularity | A popularity score between 0 and 100 on a given date | `95` |
| streams | The total number of streams on Spotify in a country on a given date | `544851` | 
| country | Country abbreviation | `US` | 


#### Songs

| Attribute | Definition | Example | 
| :---- | :---- | :---- | 
| song_id | An identifier associated with each song | `22403119` |
| song_name | The name of the song | `WAP (feat. Megan Thee Stallion)` |
| artists |  A list of comma-separated artists of the song | `Cardi B,Megan Thee Stallion` | 
| genres | A list of comma-separated genres of the song | `pop,rap,houston rap,pop,trap queen` |

#### Country Codes 

| Attribute | Definition | Example | 
| :---- | :---- | :---- | 
| continent | The continent associated with the country | `North America` |
| country | The name of the country | `United States of America` | 
| country_code_2_letter | The two-letter country code | `US` | 
| country_code_3_letter | The three-letter country code | `USA` | 
| country_number | The official ISO country code | `840` |

**Exercise 1**  
Download the [data sets](https://github.com/hannesdatta/course-dprep/raw/master/content/docs/tutorials/data-preparation/data.zip) and describe the structure of the data sets in your own words. What is the target unit of analysis? Do columns seem complete? Are there any values that do not make sense? Are “strings” properly encoded? What are common columns across the three files? Please keep in mind that opening the data into a spreadsheet programme such as Excel only shows you the first 1.05 million records or so (R, however, can load in all the data!).

**Solution**  
The streams data set contains the top 200 songs on given date in a country. The popularity and song id columns have missing values, the ranks are all between 1 and 200, and the number of streams seems is at least 1000. The `country` column can be joined on the `country_code_2_letter` from the country_codes file. Similarly, the `song_id` can be joined on the `song_id` from songs.csv. The `song_name` column has some non-ASCII characters (e.g., `Ë™™Â•Ω‰∏çÂì≠`) here and there. Roughly one sixth of all songs is not associated with any genre tags, 17 songs don't have any song id, and for 9 songs the artist is missing. 

\

**Exercise 2**  
Merge all three files into a single data frame `df` and export the result as `merged_df.csv`. Keep in mind the following instructions:

* Use the merge functions of `dplyr` and aim for concise code (tip: look up the DataCamp tutorials for the syntax!).
* Note that CSV-files are separated by commas (hence the name comma-separated-value!) but they can also be separated by other delimiters (e.g., `;`). You need to explicitly tell the `read.csv()` function which one to use!
* Examine the effect of picking a left, right, and inner join, and how that affects the completeness of your data. Strive for a final data frame that captures as much of the original data as possible.
* To avoid confusion between overlapping column names (e.g., country appears in both `streams.csv` and `country_codes.csv`), you may consider adding suffixes. 


**Solution**  
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("dplyr") - run this command if you have never used the package before
library(dplyr)

# input
streams <- read.csv("streams.csv", sep=",")
songs <- read.csv("songs.csv", sep=",")
country_codes <- read.csv("country_codes.csv", sep=";")

# transformation
df <- streams %>% 
  inner_join(songs, by = "song_id") %>%
  left_join(country_codes, by = c("country" = "country_code_2_letter"), suffix = c("_streams", "_cc"))

# Since countries in Oceania are missing in country_codes.csv we use a left join here (otherwise you'd miss out on +/- 139K records)

# output
write.csv(df, "merged_df.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```


\

#### 1.2 Duplicates

\

**Exercise 3**  
A track can appear in multiple top 200 lists across countries (e.g., both in the Netherlands and in Belgium) for sustained periods of time (e.g., yesterday and today). For that reason, a `song_id` may occur repeatedly within the data frame. Yet it can also happen that exactly the same record appears more than once. For example, the scraper that collected the data in the first place might have run twice which duplicated some of the records, or we accidentally made a copy-paste mistake ourselves. Check whether such duplicates are present in `df` and if so remove them. Export the result as `df_no_duplicates.csv`.

\

**Solution**  
```{r eval=FALSE}
#input
df <- read.csv("merged_df.csv", sep=",")

# transformation
df <- df %>% filter(!duplicated(df))

# output
write.csv(df, "df_no_duplicates.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

\

#### 1.3 Data Imputation 
In roughly half of the cases, the `popularity` column is missing which turns out to be troublesome once you move towards a model building phase. Therefore, we ask you to impute these missing values by the median popularity score of the country on a given date. Here's a simple example to illustrate: 

| song_name | country | date | popularity | popularity_filled | 
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :----- | :---- |
| A | United Kingdom | 01-01-2020 | 91 | 91 |
| B | United Kingdom | 01-01-2020 | 66 | 66 |
| C | United Kingdom | 01-01-2020 | `NA` |  **66** |
| D | United Kingdom | 01-01-2020 | 62 | 62 | 
| E | United Kingdom | 02-01-2020 | 79 | 79 | 
| A | Netherlands | 01-01-2020 | 80 | 80 |

The `popularity_filled` column has been added which takes on the value of the `popularity` column if present and otherwise missing data (`NA`) are replaced with their imputed values. In this example, the popularity of song `C` in the United Kingdom has been computed as the median of `{62, 66, 91} = 66`. Note that it does not take into account song `E` in the United Kingdom (different date) and song `A` in the Netherlands (different country).   


**Exercise 4**  
Implement this data imputation strategy using the `filter`, `groupby`, and `summarise` functions from the `dplyr` package and the result as `df_imputed.csv`. We recommend first computing the imputation values (for each country across the days), and then replacing missing values in the `popularity` column with their matching counterparts. Evaluate your results in terms of the pros and cons of this approach and try to come up with an alternative imputation strategy (incl. arguments why you prefer that approach).

**Solution**  
```{r eval=FALSE}
# input
df <- read.csv("df_no_duplicates.csv", sep=",")

# transformation
imputation_values <- df %>% filter(!is.na(popularity)) %>% 
  group_by(country, date) %>% 
  summarise(popularity_filled = median(popularity))

df_joined <- df %>% left_join(imputation_values, by = c("country" = "country", "date" = "date"))

df <- df_joined %>% mutate(popularity_filled = ifelse(is.na(popularity), popularity_filled, popularity))

# The main disadvantage is that missing records will always be assigned a median popularity score (so never abnormally low or high). Given the sheer amount of missing records, this would highly distort the distribution of the scores.
# Since the popularity score is country independent and it is either present for all records or not available for any country (or time period), we should find a way to group songs together. For example, if the artist has other songs for which the popularity score is known we could take the median of those scores, or we could look for songs with similar genre tag words.

# output
write.csv(df, "df_imputed.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

### 2. Feature Engineering

\

#### 2.1 Trend Variable
More likely than not, you have come across the `lm()` (i.e., linear model) function once before during your studies. Then, you also know that a regression model can only interpret numeric data. Categorical fields are typically converted into so-called dummy variables that take on either the value `0` or `1`. In a similar vein, dates are often converted into trend variables as input for a time-series model. For example, in our dataset January the 1st, of 2020 becomes 1 and the 15th of December 2020 (the last entry of `df`) becomes 350. Follow the steps below to create this trend variable for the `date` column of `df`: 

\

**Exercise 5**  
1. Study the [documentation](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/seq.Date.html) of the `seq` function to create a sequence of dates (see examples at the bottom of the page).
2. Create a data frame `dates` with two columns: `date` (i.e., the sequence of dates) and `counter` (i.e., a numeric value between 1 and 350). Tip: you may first need to convert the `dates` column into character format (`as.charcter(date)`).
3. Merge `df` and `dates` and inspect your results (which type of join do you use?)


**Solution**  
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Step 1
date <- seq(min(as.Date(df$date)), max(as.Date(df$date)), by = "day")

# Step 2
counter <- 1:length(date)
dates <- data.frame(cbind(counter=counter, date=as.character(date)))

# Step 3
df <- df %>% inner_join(dates, by = "date")
```

\

#### 2.2 Ranks
Even though the data frame represents the Spotify top 200 charts, none of the columns indicates the rank of a given track. We can easily derive it from the number of streams, the `date`, and the `country` column. The built-in R function `ranks` returns a vector of ranks for a given input. By default, the lowest digit gets the highest rank (e.g., 1 becomes rank 1), you can reverse the order by adding a minus sign (`-`) in front of the input vector:

```{r}
rank_example = c(4, 9, 3, 2, 1)
# regular 
print(rank(rank_example))
# reversed
print(rank(-rank_example)) 
```

\

**Exercise 6**  
Add a `ranking` column to `df` using the `dplyr` package and export the result as `df_ranking.csv`. Although it is unlikely that some tracks have exactly the same number of streams, think about how you will deal with these edge cases (tip: run `?rank` to look up the documentation). Does your ranking always run from 1 to 200? Why is that? Investigate the root cause and fix it! 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# input
df <- read.csv("df_imputed.csv", sep=",")

# transformation
df <- df %>% group_by(country, date) %>%
  mutate(ranking = rank(-streams, ties.method = "random"))

# The maximum ranking is 400 (rather than 200)
# Once we inspect one of the listings of df[df$ranking >= 200, ] we find that these records typically have redundant data somewhere hidden in between. For example, for df[(df$date == "2020-05-17") & (df$country == "HK"),] we discover that ranking 59 appears 17 times (!) which can be attributed to missing values `song_id` 

# remove rows without song_id (if you then recreate the ranking column you'll come to the conclusion the maximum ranking has become 200!)
df <- df[!is.na(df$song_id),]

# output
write.csv(df, "df_ranking.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

\

#### 2.3 Reshape 

The lion share of tracks are assigned to more than one genre. For example, the famous song "Señorita" by Shawn Mendes and Camilo Cabello is categorized as `pop`, but also as `canadian pop`, `post-teen pop`, `viral pop`, and `dance pop`. The data frame stores these records as a list of comma-separated genres. On a high level, we like to move from this state: 

| song_name | genres | 
| :----- | :---- | 
| Señorita | `pop, canadian pop, post-teen pop, viral pop, dance pop` | 

\

To a format in which the columns represent genre tag words and the table values indicate which genre(s) belong to which `song_name`: 

| song_name | k-pop | pop | canadian pop | post-teen pop | viral pop | dance pop | 
| :----- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | 
| Señorita | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| Memories | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Psycho | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

\

To this end, we first need to separate the `genres` column of `df` into individual genres. We can use the built-in R function `strsplit` for that in the following way (note the double brackets `[[]]` around `1`!): 

\

```{r}
genres_example <- c("pop", "canadian pop", "post-teen pop", "viral pop", "dance pop")
genres_example_split <- split(genres_example, ",")
genres_example_split[[1]]

```

After some data wrangling we can transform the data into the following format: 

| song_id | song_genre | 
| :----- | :---- | 
| 13594414 | pop | 
| 13594414 | canadian pop | 
| 13594414 | post-teen pop | 
| 13594414 | viral pop | 
| 13594414 | dance pop | 
| 13977556 | pop` | 

\

**Exercise 7**   
As a last step, we call the `dcast()` function of the `reshape2` package to transform the data frame into the desired format (see the documentation of the package for details!), and export the results as `df_reshaped.csv`. 

Following these steps, it's your turn to create a data set, with (a) rows being the dates, (b) columns being the song IDs, and (c) the cells indicating a song's total number of streams.

\

**Solution**  
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(reshape2)

# load input
df <- read.csv("df_ranking.csv", sep=",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

song_popularity = dcast(df, formula=date~song_id, fun.aggregate = sum, value.var = "streams")

# let us look at the columns (--> these are song IDs!)
colnames(song_popularity)

# let us look at the rows (--> these are dates!)
song_popularity$date[1:10]

# output
write.csv(song_popularity, "df_reshaped.csv")
```
