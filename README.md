A vast amount of domestic and international travelers come to the city to enjoy this event. Staying in an Airbnb is a viable option for guests who don't live in or nearby the city.# Analysis description**Two analyses are planned for this project****#analysis 1****Check the correlation between ADE and the amount of reviews left by guests**The amount of reviews can be retrieved from the dataset. An event such as ADE might boost the motivation to leave a review, which can be further investigated. The reviews can be left by guests of Airbnb up to 2 weeks after the end day of the stay. For this reason, the main time period measured against standardized data has been two weeks after the last date of the event.**#analysis 2****Make a price prediction in a linear regression model**Right now, few prices can be retrieved from the dataset, as the data provider has fetched all the rates for a few dates in the year. Different columms such as the location, room type, and the review amount etc. could have impact on the price. To make a prediction for the prices of rooms throughout the city for next year's event, a regression analysis is run over these variables.
