# Style guides

1. Variable and function names consist of letters, numbers and underscores. E.g. "new_reviews".

2. Use of abbreviation. E.g. "adam_listing", "revperday".

3. Variable names are described as precise and meaningful as possible. E.g. "reviews_summer21".

4. Use of spacing after a comma, for better readability. E.g. "lm(freq~as.factor(neighbourhood_cleansed), data = new_reviews)"

5. In case a code line is too long to fit on the screen, we have used "enter" to continue the code on the next line.

6. Use of hashtags to indicate the function of the line of code below. E.g. "#Check the number of comments per day".
