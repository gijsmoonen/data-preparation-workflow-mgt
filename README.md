# Data Preparation & Workflow Management

## Research 

# Motivation
The main objective of this study is to analyze the impact of the Amsterdam Dance event, which is a yearly music festival active from 13th to 17th of October. A vast amount of domestic and international travelers come to the city to enjoy this event. Staying in an Airbnb is a viable option for guests who don't live in or nearby the city.


# Analysis description
**Two analyses are carried out in this **

**#analysis 1**
**Check the correlation between ADE and the amount of reviews left by guests**
The reviews can be left by guests of Airbnb up to 2 weeks after the end day of the stay. For this reason, the main time period measured against standardized data has been two weeks after the last date of the event.

**#analysis 2****
**Make a price prediction in a linear regression model**
Right now, few prices can be retrieved from the dataset, as the data provider has fetched all the rates for a few dates in the year. Different columms such as the location, room type, and the review amount could have impact on the price. To make a prediction for next year's event, a regression analysis is run over these variables.
